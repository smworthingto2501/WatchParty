# WatchParty
About:

  Our app is solving the problem that streaming movies and TV shows have created, indecisiveness. The inability to choose when shown such a large volume of options. This is the new “flipping through channels” where you can’t find anything to watch. WatchParty allows the user to swipe for their own watchlist or add to a group watch playlist. With a “Tinder” like interface, users are shown one movie at a time and as they swipe YES or NO their preferences are updated and the data is used to provide more curated options. Users can make groups with friends and if everyone swipes right, then the movie is added on to a group watchlist. Spend less time scrolling and more time watching with WatchParty!
  
For Further Iterations:
- Photos for movies in swipe deck & profile for favorite
- Further Group page functionality
- Upload profile picture
